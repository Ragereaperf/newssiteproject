The new Snabb o Arg movie was a huge success (NOT).
The main actor Bennis Dizröm was sick for the filming of the entire movie.
He had a severe depression (bunny).
The editor team then had to edit him into the movie by using a face from Bennis Facebook.
Can you believe that?? The editor team was fired after the movie and Bennis got all the
money. His depression has now been cured and he has bought the happiest bunny in the world
which suddenly got depression. Bennis has named his bunny Depression Bunny. Wonder why.

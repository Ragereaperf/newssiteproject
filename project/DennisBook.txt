Books have been said to have a huge positive impact on your brain. 
A child, who has read alot of books
at an early age has said to be better at writing and reading than an Univerity Student
who just graduated. However Professor Denizé Biscuit claims that reading books is bad
for your brain, although here is a picture of Denizé reading a book.

reading books is bad for you.
